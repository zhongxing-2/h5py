"""
    Implements ObjectID base class and global object registry.

    It used to be that we could store the HDF5 identifier in an ObjectID
    and simply close it when the object was deallocated.  However, since
    HDF5 1.8.5 they have started recycling object identifiers, which
    breaks this system.

    We now use a global registry of "proxy objects".  This is implemented
    via a weak-value dictionary which maps an integer representation of the
    identifier to an IDProxy object.  There is only one IDProxy object in
    the universe for each integer identifier.  Objects hold strong references
    to this "master" IDProxy object.  As they are deallocated, the
    reference count of the IDProxy decreases.  The use of a weak-value
    dictionary means that as soon as no ObjectIDs remain which reference the
    IDProxy, it is deallocated, closing the HDF5 integer identifier in
    its __dealloc__ method.
