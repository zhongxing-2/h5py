Announcing HDF5 for Python (h5py) 1.1
=====================================

What is h5py?
-------------

HDF5 for Python (h5py) is a general-purpose Python interface to the
Hierarchical Data Format library, version 5.  HDF5 is a versatile,
mature scientific software library designed for the fast, flexible
storage of enormous amounts of data.

From a Python programmer's perspective, HDF5 provides a robust way to
store data, organized by name in a tree-like fashion.  You can create
datasets (arrays on disk) hundreds of gigabytes in size, and perform
random-access I/O on desired sections.  Datasets are organized in a
filesystem-like hierarchy using containers called "groups", and 
accesed using the tradional POSIX /path/to/resource syntax.

In addition to providing interoperability with existing HDF5 datasets
and platforms, h5py is a convienient way to store and retrieve
arbitrary NumPy data from disk.


New features in 1.1
-------------------

  - A new compression filter based on the LZF library, which provides
    transparent compression many times faster than the standard HDF5
    GZIP filter.

  - Efficient broadcasting using HDF5 hyperslab selections; for example,
    you can write to a (100 x 100 x 50) selection from a (100 x 50) array.

  - Now installable via easy_install

  - Now supports the NumPy boolean type


Standard features
-----------------

  - Supports storage of NumPy data of the following types:

    * Integer/Unsigned Integer
    * Float/Double
    * Complex/Double Complex
    * Compound ("recarray")
    * Strings
    * Boolean
    * Array (as members of a compound type only)
    * Void

  - Random access to datasets using the standard NumPy slicing syntax,
    including fancy indexing and point-based selection

  - Transparent compression of datasets using GZIP, LZF or SZIP,
    and error-detection using Fletcher32

  - "Pythonic" interface supporting dictionary and NumPy-array metaphors
    for the high-level HDF5 abstrations like groups and datasets

  - A comprehensive, object-oriented wrapping of the HDF5 low-level C API
    via Cython, in addition to the NumPy-like high-level interface.

  - Supports many new features of HDF5 1.8, including recursive iteration
    over entire files and in-library copy operations on the file tree
