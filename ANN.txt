Announcing HDF5 for Python (h5py) 2.1.0
=======================================

We are proud to announce the availability of HDF5 for Python (h5py) 2.1.0.
HDF5 for Python (h5py) is a general-purpose Python interface to the
Hierarchical Data Format library, version 5.  HDF5 is a mature scientific
software library originally developed at NCSA, designed for the fast,
flexible storage of enormous amounts of data.

From a Python programmer's perspective, HDF5 provides a robust way to
store data, organized by name in a tree-like fashion.  You can create
datasets (arrays on disk) hundreds of gigabytes in size, and perform
random-access I/O on desired sections.  Datasets are organized in a
filesystem-like hierarchy using containers called "groups", and 
accessed using the traditional POSIX /path/to/resource syntax.

Downloads, FAQ and bug tracker are available at Google Code:

* Google code site:  http://h5py.googlecode.com

Documentation is available at Alfven.org:

What's new in h5py 2.1
-----------------------

* The HDF5 Dimension Scales API is now available, along with high-level
  integration with Dataset objects.  Thanks to D. Dale for implementing this.

* Unicode scalar strings can now be stored in attributes.

* Dataset objects now expose a .size property giving the total number of
  elements.

* Many bug fixes.
