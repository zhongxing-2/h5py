Low-Level API Reference
=======================

**This is a testing version of the h5py low-level API documentation.  It is
not guaranteed to be complete or correct.**

**For the current h5py documentation, please go to** http://www.h5py.org/docs.

This documentation contains the auto-generated API information for the
HDF5 for Python "low-level" interface, a collection of Cython modules
which form the interface to the HDF5 C library.  It's hosted separately from
our main documentation as it requires autodoc.

These docs are updated less frequently than the spiffy ReadTheDocs-hosted
main documentation; this means roughly once per minor (X.Y) release.
