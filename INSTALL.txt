Installation instructions for the h5py package
==============================================

Version 0.2.2

This package is designed to be installed from source.  You will need
Python and a C compiler, for distutils to build the extensions.  Pyrex_ is
not required unless you want to change compile-time options, like the
debugging level.

It's strongly recommended you use the versions of these packages provided
by your operating system's package manager/finder.  In particular, HDF5 can
be painful to install manually.

Requires
--------
- Unix-like environment (created/tested on 32-bit Intel linux)
- Python with headers for development ("python-dev")
- Numpy_ 1.0.3 or higher
- HDF5_ 1.6.5 or higher (1.8 support experimental)
- A working compiler for distutils
- (Optionally) Pyrex_ 0.9.8.4 or higher

.. _HDF5: http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/
.. _Pyrex: http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/

Procedure
---------
1.  Unpack the tarball and cd to the resulting directory
2.  Run ``python setup.py build`` to build the package
3.  Run ``python setup.py test`` to run unit tests in-place (optional)
4.  Run ``sudo python setup.py install`` to install into your main Python
    package directory.

Additional options
------------------
 --pyrex         Have Pyrex recompile changed pyx files.
 --pyrex-only    Have Pyrex recompile changed pyx files, and stop.
 --pyrex-force   Recompile all pyx files, regardless of timestamps.
 --no-pyrex      Don't run Pyrex, no matter what

 --hdf5=path     Use alternate HDF5 directory (containing bin, include, lib)
 --api=<n>       Specifies API version.  Only --api=16 is currently useful.
 --debug=<n>     If nonzero, compile in debug mode.  The number is
                 interpreted as a logging-module level number.  Requires
                 Pyrex for recompilation.
