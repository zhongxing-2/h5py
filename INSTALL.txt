========================
Installation of h5py 1.1 
========================

This document is a very quick overview of the installation procedure for UNIX.
Full documentation is on the web at h5py.alfven.org.  Windows users should
download a binary installer; installation from source is only supported on
UNIX-like platforms (Linux and Mac OS-X).


Before you start
----------------

You will first need to install HDF5, preferably via a package manager.  Both
versions 1.6 and 1.8 are supported.  NumPy 1.0.3 (numpy.scipy.org) or later
is also required.


Installation
------------

H5py can now be automatically installed by setuptools' easy_install command:

    [sudo] easy_install h5py

Alternatively, you can install in the traditional manner by running setup.py:

    python setup.py build
    [sudo] python setup.py install


Custom options
--------------

Sometimes h5py may not be able to determine what version of HDF5 is installed.
Also, sometimes HDF5 may be installed in an unusual location.  You can
specify both your version of HDF5 and its location through environment
variables:

    $ export HDF5_DIR=/path/to/hdf5
    $ export HDF5_API=<16 or 18>

These options will work for both easy_install and manual installation.
Both are optional.


Running tests
-------------

H5py has a battery of built-in tests.  To run them, simply do:

    python setup.py nosetests

Please report test failures to the author, either to [h5py at alfven dot org]
or the bug tracker at http://h5py.googlecode.com.

Thanks for using h5py!
