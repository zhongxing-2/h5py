Installation of h5py
====================

Requires:
---------
* A Unix/Linux environment
* Python 2.5
* Pyrex
  http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/
* HDF5 1.6.5 or higher (1.8 untested)

Installation
------------

1.  Unpack the tarball and cd to the resulting directory
2.  Run ``python setup.py build`` to build the package
3.  [optional] Run ``python setup.py test`` to run unit tests
4.  Run ``sudo python setup.py install`` to install into your main Python
    package directory.

Bugs
----
I expect there are many. :) You can start a ticket at h5py.googlecode.com, or
email me ("h5py" at the domain "alfven dot org").  h5py is very new and still
under development.
