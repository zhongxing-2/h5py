New features
------------

* It is now possible to call certain hdf5 function without the GIL
  For this, just append the nogil argument in api-function.txt and rebuild
* Function dealing with datasets are now releasing the GIL. This allows to
  interleave IO, GUI and processing nicely from Python.
* Multi-threaded I/O is possible but no performance gain is to be expected !
* Conversion callback (in H5T) are re-acquiring the GIL as needed.
* All other callbacks are now re-acquiring the GIL as needed.
* Release GIL for internal HDF5 reference counting operation (inc, dec, count)
