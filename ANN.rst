Announcing HDF5 for Python (h5py) 2.3.0
=======================================

The h5py team is happy to announce the availability of h5py 2.3.0 (final).
Thanks to everyone who provided beta feedback!

What's h5py?
------------

The h5py package is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.

It lets you store huge amounts of numerical data, and easily manipulate
that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice into multi-terabyte
datasets stored on disk, as if they were real NumPy arrays. Thousands of
datasets can be stored in a single file, categorized and tagged however
you want.

Changes
-------

This release introduces some important new features, including:

* Support for arbitrary vlen data
* Improved exception messages
* Improved setuptools support
* Multiple additions to the low-level API
* Improved support for MPI features
* Single-step build for HDF5 on Windows

Major fixes since beta:

* LZF compression crash on Win64
* Unhelpful error message relating to chunked storage
* Import error for IPython completer on certain platforms
