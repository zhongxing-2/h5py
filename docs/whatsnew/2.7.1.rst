What's new in h5py 2.7.1
========================

Fix h5py segfaulting on some Python 3 versions
----------------------------------------------
Through an intersection of `Python Issue 30484`_ and :issue:`888`, it was
possible for the Python Garbage Collector to activate when closing ``h5py``
objects, which due to how dictionaries were iterated over in Python could
cause a segfault. :issue:`903` fixes the Garbage Collector activating whilst
closing, whilst `Python Issue 30484`_ had been fixed upstream (and backported
to Python 3.3 onwards).

Avoid unaligned memory access in conversion functions
-------------------------------------------------------
Some architectures (e.g. SPRAC64) do not allow unaligned memory access, which
can come up when copying packed structs. :issue:`904` (by James Clarke) uses
``memcpy`` to avoid said unaligned memory access.
