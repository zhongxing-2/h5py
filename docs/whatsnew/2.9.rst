What's new in h5py 2.9
======================

New features
------------

* A convenient high-level API for creating virtual datasets, HDF5 objects which
  act as a view over one or more real datasets (:issue:`1060`, :issue:`1126`).
  See :ref:`vds` for details.
* :class:`h5py.File` can now be constructed with a Python file-like object,
  making it easy to construct an HDF5 file in memory using :class:`io.BytesIO`
  (:issue:`1061`, :issue:`1105`, :issue:`1116`).
  See :ref:`file_fileobj` for details.
* New options to record the order of insertion for attributes and group entries.
  Iterating over these collections now follows insertion order if it was
  recorded, or name order if not (:issue:`1098`).

Support for old Python
----------------------

Support for Python 3.3 has been dropped.

Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped.
