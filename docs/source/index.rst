Python bindings for the HDF5 library
====================================

The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the 
`HDF5 library`__ from Python.  The low-level interface is
intended to be a complete wrapping of the HDF5 1.6 API, while the high-
level component supports Python-style object-oriented access to HDF5 files, 
datasets and groups.

The goal of this package is not to provide yet another scientific data
model. It is an attempt to create as straightforward a binding as possible
to the existing HDF5 API and abstractions, so that Python programs can
easily deal with HDF5 files and exchange data with other HDF5-aware
applications.
